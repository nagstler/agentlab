# AgentLab ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–

AgentLab is a practical, stage-by-stage learning project to **understand AI agents using LangChain**.

It focuses on building from the ground up â€” starting with basic agents and progressively introducing tools, memory, custom prompts, and advanced agent types.

Each stage introduces a new capability with:
- Its own agent and tools
- A simple script to run and observe the behavior

---

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nagstler/agentlab
cd agentlab
cp .env.example .env   # Add your OpenAI API Key
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run any stage:

```bash
python run/run_agent_vX.py  # Replace X with stage number (0 to 5 so far)
```

## ðŸ§­ Stage-by-Stage Breakdown

### âœ… Stage 0: Basic Agent (ReAct + OpenAI)

- Setup a basic project layout
- Use OpenAI's LLM with a built-in `llm-math` tool
- Understand LangChainâ€™s ReAct-style reasoning loop
- Run a basic agent using `.invoke()`

Script: `run/run_agent_v0.py`

---

### ðŸ”§ Stage 1: Custom Tool â€“ `my_calc`

- Write a local calculator function
- Wrap it using LangChain's `Tool` class
- Replace built-in tools with your own
- Learn LangChainâ€™s tool interface

Script: `run/run_agent_v1.py`

---

### ðŸ§  Stage 2: Multi-Tool Agent

- Add multiple tools (e.g. calculator + reverse text)
- Let the agent choose the appropriate tool at runtime
- See tool routing decisions in the output

Script: `run/run_agent_v2.py`

---

### ðŸ§¾ Stage 3: Add Memory

- Enable multi-turn conversations using `ConversationBufferMemory`
- Let the agent remember results across turns
- Simulate a conversational assistant

Script: `run/run_agent_v3.py`

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Stage 4: Custom Prompt Template

- Customize the agentâ€™s system prompt (introduce "Marvin" persona)
- Inject tone and behavior into the agent
- Influence tool use and response style with prompt tweaks

Script: `run/run_agent_v4.py`

---

### ðŸ§© Stage 5: Function-Calling Agent (Structured Tools)

- Use `StructuredTool` for typed input functions
- Build a function-calling agent using `gpt-4`
- Implement structured prompts with memory and tool routing
- Learn prompt design for `OpenAIFunctionsAgent`

Script: `run/run_agent_v5.py`

---

## âœ… What Weâ€™ve Learned So Far

- How LangChain agents work under the hood
- Building and wiring tools for agent use
- Controlling behavior with memory and prompts
- Using OpenAIâ€™s function interface for structured reasoning

---

## ðŸ“Œ Next Stages (WIP)

- Stage 6: ToolRetriever + Dynamic Tool Selection (via embeddings)
- Stage 7: Tracing and Debugging
- Stage 8: LangGraph Migration
- Stage 9: Serve via FastAPI
- Stage 10: Production and Evaluation

---

Each stage builds on the last. You can run any stage independently, modify the tools, or create your own variations.

This is a **learning repo**, not a production framework â€” built for clarity and deep understanding.
